# Stock Market Monitor

## Short description

This code was created as a way to monitor their stocks purchased for investment purposes.\
Ideally, the code is ran on a webserver, such as PythonAnywhere, and runs the script automatically when the stock market opens.

## Hidden elements
- API Keys
- Auth tokens
- Emails and passwords

## Limitations
Due to financial constraints, the code uses only the closing data of the stock market. This is because the Alphavantage API used originally for the code is limited to only a couple API calls a day, so trading with this program is not possible with the free API.

## Environment
- Python 3.12
